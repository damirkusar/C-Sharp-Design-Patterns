Definition

Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

Frequency of use: Medium high




The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

Strategy  (SortStrategy)
- declares an interface common to all supported algorithms. Context uses this interface to call the algorithm defined by a ConcreteStrategy

ConcreteStrategy  (QuickSort, ShellSort, MergeSort)
- implements the algorithm using the Strategy interface

Context  (SortedList)
- is configured with a ConcreteStrategy object
- maintains a reference to a Strategy object
- may define an interface that lets Strategy access its data.
