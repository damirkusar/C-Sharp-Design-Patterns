Definition

Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.

Frequency of use: Medium low





The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

Mediator  (IChatroom)
- defines an interface for communicating with Colleague objects

ConcreteMediator  (Chatroom)
- implements cooperative behavior by coordinating Colleague objects
- knows and maintains its colleagues

Colleague classes  (Participant)
- each Colleague class knows its Mediator object
- each colleague communicates with its mediator whenever it would have otherwise communicated with another colleague
