Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

Frequency of use: Hi




The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

Iterator  (AbstractIterator)
- defines an interface for accessing and traversing elements.

ConcreteIterator  (Iterator)
- implements the Iterator interface.
- keeps track of the current position in the traversal of the aggregate.

Aggregate  (AbstractCollection)
- defines an interface for creating an Iterator object

ConcreteAggregate  (Collection)
- implements the Iterator creation interface to return an instance of the proper ConcreteIterator
