Definition

Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. 
Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.

Frequency of use: Medium low




The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

Handler   (Approver)
- defines an interface for handling the requests
- (optional) implements the successor link

ConcreteHandler   (Director, VicePresident, President)
- handles requests it is responsible for
- can access its successor
- if the ConcreteHandler can handle the request, it does so; otherwise it forwards the request to its successor

Client   (ChainApp)
- initiates the request to a ConcreteHandler object on the chain
