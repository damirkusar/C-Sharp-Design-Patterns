Definition

Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Frequency of use: High




The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

Subject  (Stock)
- knows its observers. Any number of Observer objects may observe a subject
- provides an interface for attaching and detaching Observer objects.

ConcreteSubject  (Tesla)
- stores state of interest to ConcreteObserver
- sends a notification to its observers when its state changes

Observer  (IInvestor)
- defines an updating interface for objects that should be notified of changes in a subject.

ConcreteObserver  (Investor)
- maintains a reference to a ConcreteSubject object
- stores state that should stay consistent with the subject's
- implements the Observer updating interface to keep its state consistent with the subject's
