Definition

Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

Frequency of use: Medium




The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

Context  (Account)
- defines the interface of interest to clients
- maintains an instance of a ConcreteState subclass that defines the current state.

State  (State)
- defines an interface for encapsulating the behavior associated with a particular state of the Context.

Concrete State  (FreemiumState, SilverState, GoldState)
- each subclass implements a behavior associated with a state of Context
