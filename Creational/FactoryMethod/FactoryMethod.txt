Definition

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

Frequency of use: High




The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

Product  (Page)
- defines the interface of objects the factory method creates

ConcreteProduct  (SkillsPage, EducationPage, ExperiencePage, ConclusionPage)
- implements the Product interface

Creator  (Document)
- declares the factory method, which returns an object of type Product. Creator may also define a default implementation of the factory method that returns a default ConcreteProduct object.
- may call the factory method to create a Product object.

ConcreteCreator  (Report, Resume)
- overrides the factory method to return an instance of a ConcreteProduct.
