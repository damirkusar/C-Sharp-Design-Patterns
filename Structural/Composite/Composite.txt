Definition 

Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

Frequency of use: Medium high




The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

Component  
- declares the interface for objects in the composition.
- implements default behavior for the interface common to all classes, as appropriate.
- declares an interface for accessing and managing its child components.
- (optional) defines an interface for accessing a component's parent in the recursive structure, and implements it if that's appropriate.

Leaf   
- represents leaf objects in the composition. A leaf has no children.
- defines behavior for primitive objects in the composition.

Composite   
- defines behavior for components having children.
- stores child components.
- implements child-related operations in the Component interface.

Client  (Main Method)
- manipulates objects in the composition through the Component interface.
