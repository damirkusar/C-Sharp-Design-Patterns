Definition

Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Façade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

Frequency of use: High




The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

Facade   
- knows which subsystem classes are responsible for a request.
- delegates client requests to appropriate subsystem objects.

Subsystem classes   (SubSystemOne, SubSystemTwo, SubSystemThree, SubSystemFour)
- implement subsystem functionality.
- handle work assigned by the Facade object.
- have no knowledge of the facade and keep no reference to it.
